# Sinatra On Cells

This is a sample Sinatra app using cells and simple_form. It aims to demonstrate how Cells allows using the Rails view API in non-rails environments like this app. This basically lets you use any cool Rails gem in any Ruby script or framework.

It's based on this introducing blog post (http://nicksda.apotomo.de/2012/06/using-rails-gems-like-simple_form-in-sinatra-or-anywhere).
